# 📊 Sales Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sales using historical order data.  
The goal is to understand sales patterns and build a machine learning model to estimate future sales.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Retail sales dataset
- Rows: 9,800
- Columns: Order details, customer info, product info, shipping details, and sales

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Date Conversion and Feature Engineering
3. Handling Missing Values
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Encoding Categorical Variables
6. Model Building (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
7. Model Evaluation using R² and MAE
8. Performance Optimization

## 📈 Results
- Best Model: Linear Regression with Feature Engineering
- R² Score: ~0.17
- Mean Absolute Error: ~238
