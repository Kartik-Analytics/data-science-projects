\## 📊 Models Implemented



\### 1️⃣ Logistic Regression

\- Used as baseline model

\- Good recall on fraud class

\- Lower precision



\### 2️⃣ Random Forest Classifier

\- Improved fraud detection

\- Better balance between precision and recall

\- Best performing model



---



\## 📈 Results



\### Logistic Regression



\- High recall for fraud cases

\- Many false positives



\### Random Forest



\- Precision (Fraud): ~87%

\- Recall (Fraud): ~83%

\- Overall Accuracy: ~99%



Random Forest performed better for this dataset.
